## Executive Summary

This project aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the years between 2010-2020 trends in the global coffee market and the evolution of these trends over the past few years. Additionally, the study will explore emerging preferences for specific types of coffee, including specialty blends and sustainable options.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is deeply personal, rooted in my connection to Ethiopia, where coffee was first discovered. Growing up in a country with such a rich coffee culture has fueled my curiosity about the global impact of this beloved beverage.

Understanding the trends, evolution, and emerging preferences in the worldwide coffee industry is not only a professional pursuit but also a personal journey to uncover the intricate connections between my cultural heritage and the global coffee landscape.
